# Simplify geometry

This reduces the number of vertices for a multi vertex and complex GeoJSON. Extremely high vertex count (over 500) seem to fail and hence this tool allows you to export a new geojson with reduced vertices. It uses an implementation of the Visvalingam-Wyatt line simplification algorithm. This tool does work with and without Fiona, but Fiona installation is recommended.
